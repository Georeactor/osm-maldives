OpenStreetMap translation work for Divehi, language of the Maldives

I hired a translator to recommend translations for key phrases on the OSM.org homepage, registration and log-in process, editor, and about page.

These translations are available under Creative Commons Zero license or Public Domain.  You can use them in other apps.

The CSV file contains several rows in the format

```
English word / phrase sentence, additional context, word count, translator's translation
